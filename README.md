# SQL-Queries

This practice assignment will reinforce important learning objectives from my SQL lessons, and allow me to take on more challenging core assignments on SQL queries within MySQL workbench.

# Task
We will use the world database that we loaded into MySQL workbench in the lesson titled "MySQL Workbench" For reference, the file can be found [here](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3569/handouts/chapter3569_5432_world.sql). 

The goal of this assignment is to get practice with SQL queries and to get familiar with using MySQL workbench. The questions are of varying difficulty levels. Some require joins.

There are 8 queries to be writeten and run in MySQL workbench to obtain the answers.
